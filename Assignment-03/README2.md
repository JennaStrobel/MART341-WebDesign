# ASSIGNMENT 3 - README
## Questions:
1. What **base-linter** and **linter-htmlhint** extensions should I get for Visual Studio Code?
2. Can you create a folder in GitHub without creating any files within it, for the purpose of uploading files from a different place?
3. Did you want the Assignment3 (GitHub) and the Assignment-03 (VSC) to be separate folders in our root repo?
4. While making this document, I could not get the image to show up until I removed the period from (/Assignment3/Assignment-03/images/VSC-screenshot.png). Why did I have to do that, when it worked before in VSC?

## Summary of Work:

I first worked through the module content on the course website, which covered the following:
- the internet, 
- the World Wide Web, 
- and many associated topics, including:
    - binary code, bits, bytes, and packets;
    - the physical nature of the internet,
    - Internet Protocols and DNS,
    - HTTP/HTTPS and their error codes, and
    - web addresses and URLs.

Then I began to work with Visual Studio Code. I had already installed the software, so I explored some of the extensions and themes mentioned on the course website. There are so many options of seemingly the same thing! Due to the sheer variety of options, I was unsure exactly what extensions to get, and whether it would even make a significant difference in practice. I think I found most of the extensions mentioned, except the *base-linter* and *linter-htmlhint* options. Once I had set up my interface, I created the required files and information using the [provided tutorials](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/webDesignFall2024/topic-02/overview/). When it came time to upload these files into GitHub, I tried to make a folder without making any files within it so I could upload files separately, but could not figure out how. I then realized that I would need to make this README file anyway, so it was irrelevant, but I am still curious if it is possible. I did learn how to insert both links and images like this one:
