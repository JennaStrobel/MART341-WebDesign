# Homework Questions:

**Explain how web browsers function. How do web browsers really work behind the scenes?**

Web browsers function by, at the most basic level, asking servers for information, receiving it, translating it, and displaying the information as a web page. This requires a complicated, intricate interaction between servers, the network, and the browser's components to reach the end goal of displaying specific information in the specified format. The browser components include a rendering engine in charge of the visual representation of the page, a browser engine in charge of directing actions and communications, an interpreter to translate programming languages into their final applications within the webpage, data storage to retain information and improve user experience, and more. There is also the DOM, which specifies what certain elements are supposed to do, and breaks these elements down into an organized tree. By covering different aspects of the webpage, the computer processer can quickly provide the user with a fully usable, interactive webpage.

**What is the DOM (Document Object Model), and how does it power your web pages?** 

The DOM is an application that creates a tree structure with nodes representing each element specified in the HTML. This creates an organization system that is readable to the next steps of loading a webpage by saying "this element says to make a new paragraph" rather than the jargon of the programming language that you don't want end users to see. This system also makes it easy to link styling elements from CSS to the applicable HTML. If the CSS says "make the font Helvetica" then the DOM can apply that to only the visible text elements, and not anything non-text or that the consumer doesn't see.

**HTML, XML, XHTML—what sets them apart?**

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and is the oldest internet language. It constructs the foundation and structure of the pages content using standard elements and tags. XML stands for Extensible Markup Language, and is complementary to HTML, but it describes nodes rather than displaying them. It is used when you want to update a page without reloading the whole thing, or losing data in the process. It does not have a standardized system; the author must create one. XHTML attempts to combine the two, resulting in the Extensible HyperText Markup Language, which corrects some issues of HTML with mobile devices. It also ensures better code due to strict requirements, but also results in a more finicky, time-consuming language. 

**What are the four essential elements every HTML page needs?**

Every HTML page requires:
1. a document type declaration
2. a root element
3. a head element
4. a body element

**What’s the purpose of the index.html page, and where should it be placed?**

The index.html page is meant to be a master page explaining the page and/or site. This will be the first thing a browser looks for and displays when processing a webpage. Basically every site must have one - the homepage - but may have more as needed. It should be placed just within the root repository.

**Review: What are the top naming practices for clean and organized code?**

1. Keep a consistent file folder structure and organization system.
2. Avoid multiple subdirectories when possible.
3. Keep everything relating to your website inside the Root directory, but DO NOT add anything that doesn't have direct relation to your website.
4. Make broad content folders to organize content by. Use them.
5. Keep your index.html and/or README.md on the top level, just within your Root directory.
6. Naming conventions: NO SPACES. no funky characters. Capitals are okay if your file naming structure allows it, like camel casing, and you are consistent.


## I did some things. I don't know if it's right, but I did it.

### mostly my thoughts and questions as I worked through things this week. enjoy

So I think I understand HTML a bit. That was nice and straight forward. I did have struggles with GitHub and figuring out how to fix my directories because I didn't know how to do anything and I definitely screwed a few things up.

I do still wonder why you can't just rename directories? Do I have to redo everything? Can I copy files? Why can't I click and drag them to a new folder like any other file explorer? Anyways, I really need to figure that out. 

But on a brighter note, HTML is actually making a surprising amount of sense to my very non-technical brain, so that's a plus.

But wait, there's more! Why doesn't this README show up in GitHub? Por que? I do not understand. Does it not update in Github after you upload it?

Update: I have deleted that directory and reuploaded it. It worked, but I'm pretty sure there should be a better way to update your files. I am now updating this file directly in GitHub, which may or may not be wise. I guess we'll see if something else breaks.
