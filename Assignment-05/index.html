<h1>Maiden Home</h1>
<h3>mid-century modern furniture</h3>

<p>Maiden Home is a high-end furniture website selling mid-century and japandi style furniture pieces. The website aims to be professional, sleek, and aesthetic. The website achieves these goals by using small, modern style fonts in minimal amounts; keeping photography consistent in lighting and color. The background and overall aesthetic of the website is minimal and neutral, emphasizing the products over the website itself.</p>

<h1>Moribyan</h1>
<h3>recipes for ethnic cooking</h3>

<p>Moribyan is a website and blog by Hajar Larbah that contains a plethora of recipes for copycats from restaurants, healthy dishes, and ethnic foods from around the world. Hajar's roots in North Africa not only inspire her cooking, but also the aesthetic of her website. She combines a modern style of font and website layout with an eastern-inspired color palette and style. The website is calming with a clean, modern aesthetic, but with undertones of whimsy and creativity.</p>

<h1>Thriftbooks</h1>
<h3>deals on new and used books</h3>
<br />
<p>Thriftbooks is a website that sells new and used books at a discount. This website is not as focused on aesthetic as the previous two, as the target market is people looking for a deal, not people looking for an experience. Thus, the content is more condensed and less imagery-focused, instead emphasizing products. However, despite the focus on sales, Thriftbooks does not particularily emphasize professionalism either. I think this is because the people would assume that books would be expensive or exclusive somehow; the site reflects the second-hand and more casual nature of the business, even down to the more playful, bold color palette than you would typically see on a classy, high end site. That being said, I do think Thriftbooks would benefit if they updated their fonts and overall style to be a bit more modern, or lean completely into a vintage vibe like the photo below.</p>
