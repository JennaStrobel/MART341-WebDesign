<h1>Website Ideas</h1>

<h3>Interior Design Website</h3>

<p>My first idea is for an interior design inspiration website, which would combine a portfolio of my own work with inspiration from places like Pinterest, Houzz, vendors, etc. I would go for a minimal, but creative and inviting vibe.</p>

<h3>Recipe Blog</h3>

<p>My second idea is for a recipe and travel blog, which would feature recipes from around the world, with resources to learn more about each region or country, and more resources to find where you can buy more obscure ingredients. I would go for an adventurous, fun-loving vibe.<p>

<h3>Creative Spotlight</h3>

<p>My third idea is website that people could subscribe to that would feature an artist, musician, author, or other creative each week, which would give attention to underrated creatives and help people explore new ideas and media, or just enjoy learning about something new. I would go for a progressive, yet down-to-earth vibe that communicates that the creatives featured are just normal people, but are up-and-coming in culture.</p>
