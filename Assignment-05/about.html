<h1>Why I Chose These Sites</h1>
<br />
<h3>Interior Design Website</h3>
<p>I chose this idea because it is something I am interested in - I did get a whole degree in interior design. I think everyone should have access to good design in their homes; most people just don't know where to look. My idea would be to give people accessible, affordable resources for furniture, materials, finishes, etc. as well as inspiration for many different styles, not just what's popular on HGTV. I could also showcase and offer my skills in whatever capacity I chose, without it being the backbone of the entire concept.</p>

<h3>Recipe Blog</h3>
<p>I chose this idea because cooking is a hobby of mine, and I love the idea of travelling internationally, although I haven't done much so far. I like the idea of offering variety in cuisine while also inspiring adventure. I also like the challenge of the website design, which would have to be compatible with both large amounts of text and a variety of content in the imagery, which may be hard to balance without making it too busy or too boring.</p>

<h3>Creative Feature</h3>
<p>I chose this idea because I love to be creative and to explore ways that other people are creative. I love to explore music from around the world, art in every shape and form (although I like some of it better than others), and reading interesting books of many genres. I think this idea allows for a lot of flexibility and fun, while also benefitting both creatives and subscribers to the website.</p>
