<h1>Why I Chose These Sites</h1>
<br />
<h3>Maiden Home</h3>
<p>I chose this website because it is something I am interested in - I did get a whole degree in Interior Design. I also personally enjoy this style of interior design and website design. I like how the website emphasizes the photography so much. I hope to learn how to incorporate this website style into my own work.</p>

<h3>Moribyan</h3>
<p>I chose this website for similar reasons to Maiden Home, because cooking is a hobby of mine, and I like the style of the website. It also brings unique challenges because it can include both large amounts of text in the recipe and blog elements, while also needing to emphasize the images that make people want to make the recipes. I love the way the text and images are balanced throughout the site, and want to take inspiration from this aesthetic.</p>

<h3>Thriftbooks</h3>
<p>I chose this website because I visit it frequently, and always wish I could change a few things. I like how approachable it is, as well as being easy to navigate, but I wish it had a more defined style that would help people like the experience of visiting. As mentioned previously, I think leaning into a vintage style would encourage people to think that they are not buying a used book, but rather that it is being "passed on" to them. This mentality would encourage people to buy more books because they want the experience, rather than just getting a good deal.</p>
