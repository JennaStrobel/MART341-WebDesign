            <h3>The Basics &amp; Achieving the Style</h3>
            <div id="description" class="paragraph" style="text-align: left">
            <p>
                The midcentury modern design style began - you guessed it - in the mid-20th century. The style has roots in Scandinavian design, while combining elements of the Industrial Revolution and American innovation. The spirit of the style is to be accessible to all. It emphasises clean, modern aesthetics with a hand-crafted, high-quality standard - thus the presence of big windows to the outdoors, natural woods, leather, wool, and other natural materials. This is the era where IKEA got their start by making design accessible to anyone willing to be a bit of a craftsman. While it seems simple now, IKEA was revolutionary at the time. Most furniture of the time was either mass-produced plastic goods (thanks to the Industrial Revolution) or expensive, one-of-a-kind pieces made by artisans. <br />
                If you are inspired by this style, try looking for things you can have a part in creating. Self-assembled furniture and restoring old furniture can be great ways to keep costs down and personalize your home. Also try finding hand-made accent pieces like artwork or accent pillows to bring a more personal feeling.

            <h3>Inspiration for the Mid-Century style</h3>
            <span id="Image-1" class="box image paragraph">
                <img src="./images/midcentury-1.jpg" width="700" alt="Image of a sitting area with chairs and plants" title="Mid-Century Sitting Area"/>
                <p>Sitting Area <br />
                Notice the square shaped chairs (especially the arms) and open legs on <i>all</i> the furniture. Also note the contrast between the light or bold colored furniture and the black accents on furniture, blinds, etc.</p>
            </span>

            <span id="Image-2" class="box image paragraph">
                <img src="./images/midcentury-2.jpg" width="700" alt="Image of a kitchen with a black, white, and wood color scheme" title="Mid-Century Kitchen"/>
                <p>Kitchen<br />
                Notice the balance of light neutrals and medium wood tones that contrast with the blacks, and the modern appliances, lighting fixtures, etc.</p>
            </span>

            <span id="Image-3" class="box image paragraph">
                <img src="./images/midcentury-3.jpg" width="465" alt="Image of a living room with a fireplace" title="Mid-Century Fireplace">
                <p>Living Room &amp; Fireplace<br />
                Notice the large windows, very clean and straight lines, and wood accents.</p>
            </span>

            <span id="Image-4" class="box image paragraph">
                <img src="./images/midcentury-4.jpg" width="465" alt="Image of a house exterior with wood and large windows" title="Mid-Century Exterior"/>
                <p>Exterior<br />
                Notice the large windows, open feel, and straight lines used throughout the architecture.</p>
            </span>

            <span id="Image-5" class="box image paragraph">
                <img src="./images/midcentury-5.jpg" width="465" alt="Image of a light-colored bedroom with black nightstands and lamps" title="Mid-Century Bedroom">
                <p>Bedroom<br />
                Notice the light colored paint, bedding, rug, etc. compared to the dark nightstands, lamps, and headboard. Also take note of how most of these dark elements are closer to the floor, and create a focal point in the room.</p>
            </span>

            <span id="Image-6" class="box image paragraph">
                <img src="./images/midcentury-6.jpg" width="700" alt="Image of an outdoor sitting area" title="Mid-Century Patio"/>
                <p>Outdoor Patio<br />
                Notice the neutral colors but with high contrast, and the large windows.</p>
            </span>

            <span id="Image-6" class="box image paragraph">
                <img src="./images/midcentury-7.jpg" width="700" alt="Image of a living room with a green couch and a bookshelf" title="Mid-Century Living Room"/>
                <p>Living Room<br />
                Notice the large windows and high contrast. While they didn't use the classic black, and introduced more bold colors than some other examples, this photo shows how much variation and fun the style can introduce. Remember, <i>not everything has to be neutral to be modern!</i></p>
