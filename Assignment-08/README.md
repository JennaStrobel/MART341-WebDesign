**Div (at least 2)**
I used divs to separate my page into the following sections: Navigation, Hero Image, Description, Inspiration Images, Color Palette, and Footer. I also used these divs (and a few supplemental ones) to help format/center images.

**Span (at least 2)**
I used spans for each of the inspiration images and their descriptions, so I can hopefully format them better using CSS.

**Audio (at least 1)**
I used audio that I felt related to the video I chose.

**Video (at least 1)**
I used an iframe to embed a video of life going by in a mid-century modern building. I think the video represents both the style and the way it makes people feel - classy and modern, but also natural and human.

**Iframe (at least 1)**
I used an iframe to embed a video.

**Class (at least 2)**
I used class elements on all my main section divs (specified above) to help with later styling using CSS.

**Escape character (at least 1)**
I used the intity name for "&" in one of my headings, and a subheading for an image.
