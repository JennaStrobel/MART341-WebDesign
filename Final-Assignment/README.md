Three or more pages.

**I chose to expand on an old project for an interior design website, which currently includes a homepage, questions page, checklist-type page for furniture/fixtures/equipment, and a sample style-guide page for a midcentury modern style. I created another style-guide page for a cottage style, to showcase the consistency intended throughout these pages**

A clear, well-organized layout with strong usability.

**I tried to maintain the original aesthetic of the site, while improving certain elements (especially style-wise), and created more useable elements to create an overall more functional site.**

Use of an external stylesheet.

**I have used a style.css page and a fonts.css page to apply formatting and style to my pages.**

Apply at least one font.

**I have applied the fonts Kanit and Oxygen to my pages.** 

At least one image (preferably your own or fair-use images).

**I have applied many images, including both hero and body-content images to my pages, as that is the primary function of the site. Most, if not all, are from unsplash.com**

At least one embedded media element (video, audio, Google Maps, etc.).

**I have used one video as a hero image for my homepage, to create movement and immediately draw attention from viewers and encourage them to scroll down through the site.**

Structural and semantic HTML markup with a clean and organized page layout.

**I tried to use a consistent layout & order of elements (whenever possible) and hierarchy throughout my HTML document for easy readability.**

Legible, well-commented, and error-free code.

**I tried to leave comments about the intention of the code in as many places as I could, as well as occasional comments of things to do and potential ideas for improvements when applicable.**
