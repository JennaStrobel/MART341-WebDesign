            <p>
                The cottage style has been around in one form or another since cottages existed. Beginning with whatever the local materials are - wood, clay, stone, wool, and more - meant that the cottage style is very personalized and very diverse between different regions. For us, this means that the cottage style can be whatever you think is <i>home</i>. Choose cozy pieces within a natural color palette and pair with a collection of whatever makes you think of home! To find a natural, unique color palette, try taking a picture (or finding one online) of a landscape you like, and picking out certain colors you see within it. For an even more authentic cottage feel, try finding pieces by local artisans and using local materials to further embrace the natural colors and style of your environment.

                    Notice the light-colored stucco walls, with arches rather than square corners. These softer, more organic shapes help cozy up a space and reduce the perceived formality of it. Also notice that, while the room itself is a bit dark, with dark counters and dark copper accents, the room seems warm. That is because of the very warm, yellow color of the light - another tip to a cozy home!</p>

                    While somewhat impractical to have an accent chair in your kitchen, the photo does encompass some important design philosophies. Notice the balance between light and dark on the walls, between soft and rough in the types of chairs. The balance of textures keeps the space from being too heavy and dark from all the rustic pieces, or too staged from the perfectly set-up corner, where you aren't sure if you should sit down.</p>

                    The great thing about the cottage style is that it can be whatever you want it to be. For example, instead of the yellow pillow, try envisioning a red or blue pillow. It still looks good, doesn't it? That is because the rest of the color palette is so neutral - muted blues and greens and browns that you might find if you step outside - so you can have a bright accent color - like a wildflower - and it still looks good! So, neutral doesn't have to mean boring; it simply creates a backdrop for your more exciting colors!</p>

                    <p>Decor<br />
                    A note on decor - it isn't just clutter. Decor should reflect you and your home; they are the things you like, the things you want to become conversation starters. Some people like to fill their shelves with knicknacks, while others prefer to keep a clean slate. Both are okay! Just be sure not to buy things just to "fill a space" but to actually enjoy looking at and/or using them!</p>

                    <p>Kitchens & Decor<br />
                    Kitchens can be a special challenge to decorate. They are often the heart of the home, where you want to show your best, but also must be functional. For this reason, it is best to keep the decor and knicknacks to a minimum in the kitchen, and instead choosing things that are both functional and beautiful. <br />
                    Also, a note on color. Like the photo above this one, color can be fun, but you don't have to have bright, cheery colors to have an interesting home. This photo, for example, still gives warm, welcoming vibes, but only has variations of white and wood tones. In this case, the mood comes from two factors: warm-colored wood, and natural textures.</p>

                    <p>Antiques<br />
                    Many people who like a cottage style also enjoy collecting antiques, like the old wooden chest in this photo. If you like antiques but don't want to have an old-looking house, don't worry! You won't "ruin" your home by mixing old and new. The key is to collect in moderation to keep a balance of old and new, so when you get more of one or the other, it doesn't look out-of-place. The other thing to notice is the way this chest has been set up as the focal point of the room. Rather than trying to hide the fact that it is old, celebrate it by pairing it with complementary, yet distinct pieces like the copper decor, the soft and cushy couch, and vintage-looking bottle.</p>
