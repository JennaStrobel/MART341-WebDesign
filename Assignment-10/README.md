Designate which page you're working on this week 
**index.html** for my interior design site from assignment-08

Required Techniques (Must Have):

Create a page with an external CSS style sheet
**creating CSS style sheet for interior design homepage**
Use at least 1 class selector
**used class selectors for breaks between sections, banners, paragraphs,  hyperlinks, style-guide images (individual), and footer**

Use at least 1 ID selector
**used ID selectors for the hero video, paragraph headers, element and principle paragraphs, style-guide photos (as a group), and blockquote**
 
Select at Least Three Additional Techniques:

Different background colors
**used #3C4A45 for main background, #974b23 for text content, and #73675C for the blockquote**
Different font colors
**used #E9E4D4 for main text**
Positioning
**used positioning to place many elements like banners, images, text content, and blockquote**
Opacity
**used opacity to create a layered effect for the blockquote**
Text Alignment
**used text alignment to change some text to center and others to left-align**
Borders
**used borders around some paragraph headers**
And more (feel free to experiment!)

It's certainly far from done. I would like to do more, especially with the large blocks of text, but it's too much for jsut one assignment, so I hope to keep refining it over the coming weeks.
