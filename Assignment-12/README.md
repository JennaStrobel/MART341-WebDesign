**index.html** for my design page project (from assignment-11)

#Select at least 6 of the following techniques to implement:



Sizing – Control the width and height of elements on the page.
**used sizing for many elements, but was especially important for the two-column sections, the blockquote, and images/banners.**


Overflow – Manage how content is displayed when it exceeds the element’s boundaries.


Border – Define and style borders around elements for emphasis or separation.
**used a very faint border on the outer-box of the blockquote. I wasn't intending to use a border there, but something in my CSS code is making the box only center-align vertically if I have a border**

Margin – Adjust the space outside an element, creating separation from other elements.
**used margin (and padding) to fix spacing between basically all the elements, as I had messed up the normal flow in several areas in previous assignments**

Padding – Set the space inside an element, between its content and border.

Display: Inline / Inline-block – Specify how elements are displayed in relation to others.

**used inline-block and block properties to create dropdown menu**

Dropdown – Create a dropdown menu for navigation or content organization.

**created dropdown menu for "style guides" in navigation**

Position – Control the placement of elements with properties like absolute, relative, or fixed.

**made navigation bar a fixed element**
