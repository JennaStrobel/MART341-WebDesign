            <tr>
            <td>
                Before beginning your mittens, practice your stitches. We will be using the basic <b>single crochet (SC)</b> and a <b>single crochet - back loop only (SCBLO)</b>. The look and feel will vary based on the size and texture of your yarn, but the most important thing is to get a consistent size of stitch. Make a small square using each stitch to practice. 
                    <br />
                Don't know these stitches? Follow along with <a href="materials.html">these tutorials</a>.

                Once you're comfortable, try practicing <b>increasing</b> and <b>decreasing</b> using <a href="materials.html">these tutorials</a> if you're unsure how to do this. These techniques will be used to make the rounded fingertips of the mitten, so make sure you understand them well. Again, making a small square and practicing each technique is a great way to get a feel for it. Once you've mastered these, you're ready to begin!

                <li>Measure your (or whoever will wear the mittens; referred hereafter as the <i>user</i>) thumb and wrist down to the point you want the <i>bottom</i> of the cuff to end, using the sewing tape. Make your first row of stitches up to this length. For mine, I used 25 stitches. Then add one extra stitch to use as a <dfn title="A chain stitch that is not attached to a stitch on the row below, which is used to turn the work without subtracting a stitch each time.">turning chain</dfn>.</li>
                    <ul>

                    </ul> 
                <li>Turn your work and <b>single crochet (SC)</b> all the way down. Make a turning chain at the end and turn your work again. </li>
                <li>For the third row and each row after, we will do a section of <b>single crochet - back loop only (SCBLO)</b> to make a ribbing texture for the cuff. Measure the user's wrist with the sewing tape or by holding your work up to the user's wrist, and decide how long to make your cuff. I chose 8 stitches for mine, so I will do 8 stitches of SCBLO, then SC the rest of the way back.</li>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>NOTE:</b>If desired, add a stitch marker (make definition bubble) on the last stitch of your ribbing to keep track of where it ends.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>At the end, we will do an <b>increase</b>. If you missed the tutorial on this, <a href="materials.html">click here</a>. After the increase, make a turning chain, turn, and do another increase at the beginning of row 4. At this point, you should have two more stitches than you did originally (not including turning chains).</li>
                <li>After the row 4 increase, SC down to the stitch marker, then SCBLO to the end of the row. Make a turning chain and SCBLO back up to the stitch marker, then SC to the top.</li>
                <li>At the top of row 5, make a <b>decrease</b>. If you missed this tutorial, <a href="materials.html">click here</a>. Make a turning chain, turn, make another decrease, and finish row 6 as done previously.</li>

                <li>Complete row 9 as usual and do another increase at the top, turn, and make a second increase. Complete row 10 as usual.</li>

                <p>To build a new &quot;branch&quot; off of the thumb, SC into the same stitch. Then insert your hook into the <i>stitch you just made</i>, pull up a loop, then yarn over (wrap the yarn around your hook) and pull through both loops on the hook to finish your single crochet stitch. Insert your hook into the <i>last</i> stitch you made and repeat the process.</p>

                <h5>The Left Hand</h5>
                <p>Begin by laying the finished piece out flat, with the thumb-down side on the right side. Then, vertically fold the right side over on top of the left side along the &quot;dip&quot; at the top. Secure with some stitch markers, pins, or whatever you prefer. Then fold the thumb-down piece so it faces up, then fold the other thumb piece so it lays on top. Secure as needed. This should align all the seams, which you can sew together with a yarn needle and some extra yarn.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Using thicker yarn means you'll need less stitches to reach the same length, and vice versa for thinner yarn. You can also change how thick your gloves are by using looser or tighter stitches. I tend to use looser stitches for easier crocheting, so I chose to double up my yarn instead. Check out our <a href="materials.html">Materials and Resources</a> page for more on yarn weights, techniques, etc. </li>
                <li>If you don't have stitch markers, paper clips work great!</li>
                <li>These mittens are meant for any hands! The length is determined by the number of stitches you choose, and the width can be changed by adding or subtracting extra rows (just make sure you change it by two). Other ways to change the width are by using a &quot;taller&quot; stitch than a single crochet, like a <i>half-double</i> or <i>double</i> crochet stitch. You may also need to add stitches or rows if you intend to add a fabric lining inside the mitten for extra warmth.
                <li>I wanted to make my mitten a bit shorter around the wrist, so I chose to fold it over and sew it down to make a thicker cuff.</li>
