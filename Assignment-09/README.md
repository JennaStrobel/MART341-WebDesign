# How to Make Crochet Mittens

## Materials Needed:
- crochet hook (sizing guide below)
- yarn needle
- yarn (sizing guide below)
- sewing tape measure and/or someone's hand
    - sizing guide here

## Step One: Stitches
Before beginning your mittens, practice your stitches. We will be using the basic **single crochet (SC)** and a **single crochet - back loop only (SCBLO)**. The look and feel will vary based on the size and texture of your yarn, but the most important thing is to get a consistent size of stitch. Make a small square using each stitch to practice. 

Don't know these stitches? Follow along with *these tutorials* (link to materials and resources page).

## Step Two: Increases & Decreases
Once you're comfortable, try practicing **increasing** and **decreasing** using *these tutorials* (link to materials and resources page) if you're unsure how to do this. These techniques will be used to make the rounded fingertips of the mitten, so make sure you understand them well. Again, making a small square and practicing each technique is a great way to get a feel for it. Once you've mastered these, you're ready to begin!

## Step Three: The Thumb (Front)
1. Measure your (or whoever will wear the mittens; referred hereafter as the *user*) thumb and wrist down to the point you want the *bottom* of the cuff to end, using the sewing tape. Make your first row of stitches up to this length. For mine, I used 25 stitches. Then add one extra stitch to use as a turning chain (make definition bubble).
    - *NOTE: This number may vary based on how tight your stitches are, how thick your yarn is, personal preference, etc., so don't worry if your number isn't the same as mine.
2. Turn your work and **single crochet (SC)** all the way down. Make a turning chain at the end and turn your work again. 
3. For the third row and each row after, we will do a section of **single crochet - back loop only (SCBLO)** to make a ribbing texture for the cuff. Measure the user's wrist with the sewing tape or by holding your work up to the user's wrist, and decide how long to make your cuff. I chose 8 stitches for mine, so I will do 8 stitches of SCBLO, then SC the rest of the way back.
    - If desired, add a stitch marker (make definition bubble) on the last stitch of your ribbing to keep track of where it ends.
3. At the end, we will do an **increase**. If you missed the tutorial on this, *click here* (add link to tutorials). After the increase, make a turning chain, turn, and do another increase at the beginning of row 4. At this point, you should have two more stitches than you did originally (not including turning chains).
4. After the row 4 increase, SC down to the stitch marker, then SCBLO to the end of the row. Make a turning chain and SCBLO back up to the stitch marker, then SC to the top.
5. At the top of row 5, make a **decrease**. If you missed this tutorial, *click here* (add link to tutorials). Make a turning chain, turn, make another decrease, and finish row 6 as done previously.

## Step 4: The Hand Increase (Front)
1. On row 7, do the ribbing, then hold up the work to the user's hand and measure the length of the thumb (image below). SC up to this stitch.
    - write down the number of stitches up to the thumb, and the number of stitches in the thumb, respectively. You will use these later!
2. Once there, make a second SC into the same stitch, then use a "building" technique (shown in video below) up to the length of the user's pointer finger, plus one extra stitch. Make an increase into the last stitch, make a turning chain, and finish row 8 as before.
3. Complete row 9 as usual and do another increase at the top, turn, and make a second increase. Complete row 10 as usual.

## Step 5: The Tip of the Hand (Front)
For rows 11-15, do not make any increases or decreases. Just back-and-forth. Don't forget to do SCBLO for the ribbing at the bottom!

## Step 6: The Hand Decrease (Front)
For rows 16-18, make decreases at the top using the same technique as you did for the thumb. Again, don't forget the cuff at the other end. After the decrease on row 18, make a turning chain, turn, and immediately make an increase before proceeding back toward the cuff.

## Step 7: The Hand Increase (Back)
After the first increase on row 19, also make increases on rows 20 and 21. The most important thing is to make sure it is identical to the front section, so when we fold it along the row 19 line, it will match. You can fold it at any point to check this.

## Step 8: The Tip of the Hand (Back)
For rows 22-26, do not make any increases or decreases. Fold over to confirm that it matches the front section.

## Step 9: The Hand Decrease & Thumb (Back)
1. On row 27, start with the ribbing, then complete the same number of stitches *up to* the thumb as you did for the front section. For me, this is 12 stitches. 
2. Then, chain the *same* number of stitches as you did for the thumb on the front section. For me, this is 6 stitches. Add a turning stitch, then SC into the *top* (add definition bubble) of the stitch and continue stitching to the *top* of the mitten. We'll call this a continuation of row 27.
    - You will need to turn the chain at the base in order to continue to the top of the mitten. It will also angle the thumb to face down toward the cuff.
3. At the top, turn *without decreasing*, and continue row 28 back into the thumb. At the tip of the thumb, make an increase, turn, and increase again.
4. SC back to the tip of the hand, make a decrease, turn, and decrease again. SC back to the tip of the thumb. Decrease, turn, and decrease again. SC to the top of the hand, make a decrease, and tie off.

## Step 10: Sew Together & Complete
1. Place the flat pattern so that the thumb-down side is on the right (for a left hand mitten) or the left (for a right hand mitten) Fold the completed pattern in half vertically. 
2. On the thumb down side, fold the thumb so it points up, then line up the other thumb on top of it. This should align the rest of the mitten, exactly mirrored at the top, and slightly inward on the bottom (lined up with the edge of the thumb). 
3. Secure with stitch markers if necessary and sew along seams. 
    - NOTE: How you fold the mitten changes which hand it fits. Watch both videos below to find the difference!


## Tips & Tricks
- Using thicker yarn means you'll need less stitches to reach the same length, and vice versa for thinner yarn. You can also change how thick your gloves are by using looser or tighter stitches. I tend to use looser stitches for easier crocheting, so I chose to double up my yarn instead. Check out our *Materials and Resources* (link here) page for more on yarn weights, techniques, etc. 
- If you don't have stitch markers, paper clips work great!
- The best part of this tutorial is that it is meant for any hand! The length is determined by the number of stitches you choose, and the width can be changed by adding or subtracting extra rows (just make sure you change it by two). Other ways to change the width are by using a "taller" stitch than a single crochet, like a *half-double* or *double* crochet stitch. You may also need to add stitches or rows if you intend to add a fabric lining inside the mitten for extra warmth. For more inspiration, try our *Customizing and Inspiration* (link here) page.
- I wanted to make my mitten a bit shorter around the wrist, so I chose to fold it over and sew it down to make a thicker cuff.
