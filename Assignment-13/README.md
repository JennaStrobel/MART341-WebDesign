At Least 4 Pages – Your website should contain a minimum of four distinct pages that align with a cohesive theme.

**I included 4 pages to my new site - index, about, photos, and reviews. They are distinct, with a cohesive theme, but do use filler text for some content**

Responsive Design – Ensure the website layout adjusts smoothly across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

**I used percentages, ems, or other relative measurements to ensure the layout stays consistent. I also used media queries to create a more responsive layout.**

Media Queries – Use CSS media queries to make design adjustments at specific screen widths for optimal user experience on all devices.

**attempted to use a media query to adjust screen size for mobile, but I'm not sure if I did it right**

Navigation Menu – Include a clear, user-friendly navigation menu to allow visitors to easily access each page of the site.

**I used a very minimal, clear horizontal menu across the top, using a dropdown to categorize some secondary pages.**

Dropdown Menu – Add a dropdown menu within the navigation for sub-pages or sections, if applicable.

**I used a dropdown to categorize different sections of my portfolio in the navigation menu**
