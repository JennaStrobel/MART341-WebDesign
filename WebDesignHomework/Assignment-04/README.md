#I did some things. I don't know if it's right, but I did it.

So I think I understand HTML a bit. That was nice and straight forward. I did have struggles with GitHub and figuring out how to fix my directories because I didn't know how to do anything and I definitely screwed a few things up.

I do still wonder why you can't just rename directories? Do I have to redo everything? Can I copy files? Why can't I click and drag them to a new folder like any other file explorer? Anyways, I really need to figure that out. 

But on a brighter note, HTML is actually making a surprising amount of sense to my very non-technical brain, so that's a plus.

But wait, there's more! Why doesn't this README show up in GitHub? Por que? I do not understand. Does it not update in Github after you upload it?
