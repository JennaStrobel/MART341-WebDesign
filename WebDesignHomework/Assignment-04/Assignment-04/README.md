I'm still trying to figure out last week's issues with the directory structure. I think I messed up.

On a brighter note, I think I understand HTML a little bit.

Just kidding, why are there duplicate README files? Do I not create them here anymore, only in VSC? but then how do I make folders. I don't understand what I'm doing.
Nevermind, I figured out the duplicate READMEs. I still don't know how to create a folder without making a file to go in it.
